# Loan Products Analysis

# Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of business operations, understanding user behavior, product performance, and acquisition
strategies is pivotal for informed decision-making. This Business Intelligence report delves into three key areas, each offering
unique insights crucial to growth and strategy.
Question 1 directs focus on the users dataset, calling for the creation of a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard will
unravel intricate details surrounding user behavior and the acquisition process. Insights extracted will shed light on the user
journey, acquisition efficacy, and potential avenues for optimization.
Question 2 broadens perspective by integrating both datasets. This section aims to illuminate the current status of various
products, dissecting their lifecycle from user engagement to loan performance. Through a comparative analysis, I will
uncover conversion rates, loan performance indicators, and discern positive and negative trends shaping our products.
Lastly, Question 3 navigates a cohort analysis of users acquired in January, segmented by Origin. This division into Group A
and Group B facilitates a detailed examination of cohort evolution concerning product usage. By tracking and comparing these
cohorts, we gain nuanced insights into product adoption trends and behavioral patterns.
Each question propels towards a deeper understanding of the user base, product performance, and strategic opportunities. The
subsequent sections of this report delve into these critical areas, aiming to unearth actionable insights driving business
forward.
